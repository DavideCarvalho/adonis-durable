/**
 * Run the shared Transport contract against the DB-table-backed transport (one instance acting as
 * both engine and worker over an in-memory SQLite), proving a remote step round-trips through rows to
 * a worker and back and that a throwing handler surfaces as a failed run — identical to every other
 * transport. The transport auto-creates its own tables; `assertTransportConformance` stops its
 * pollers, then we close the db.
