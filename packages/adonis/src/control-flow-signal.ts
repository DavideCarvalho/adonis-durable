/**
 * Cross-package, cross-runtime marker for engine CONTROL-FLOW signals — {@link WorkflowSuspended}
 * and {@link ContinueAsNew} (see `./errors.ts`). These are thrown by `WorkflowCtx` ops to unwind the
 * current turn — never real failures — so a workflow's `catch` block MUST rethrow them untouched.
 * Running a failure/cleanup path on a control-flow signal corrupts the run: it emits extra
 * `recordStep` commands into history that a subsequent replay didn't produce the first time,
 * surfacing as a `NonDeterminismError` on resume.
 *
 * `Symbol.for` (the GLOBAL registry), NOT a plain `Symbol()` — so a duplicate copy of this module
 * (pnpm peer-dependency multiplexing, or a dual ESM/CJS load) still collapses onto the SAME symbol.
 * Same rationale as `DURABLE_STEP_NAME` in `./step-name-symbol.ts`; uses the `@agora/` wire namespace
 * matching the other cross-package symbols in this package.
 *
 * Deliberately checked as a stamped property, NOT `instanceof` — `instanceof` only recognizes a
 * signal thrown by the SAME class the checking code imported, which fails across a duplicate module
 * copy (two different `WorkflowSuspended`/`ContinueAsNew` classes for what is, from a workflow
 * author's catch block, the same "this isn't a real error, let it through" event).
 *
 * NOT designed to survive a serialization boundary (e.g. JSON over the wire) — these signals are
 * always thrown and caught in-process within a single replay turn, never (de)serialized, so a
 * stamped-but-not-cloneable property is sufficient.

/**
 * True for any engine control-flow signal (currently: {@link WorkflowSuspended} and

 * MUST rethrow these untouched; running a failure/cleanup path on one corrupts the run's history
 * (extra commands recorded during what replay will later see as a suspend, not a failure) and the
 * resumed replay dies with a non-determinism error.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT control-flow (do not add to this predicate):
 * - a cancelled run — a TERMINAL outcome the consumer may legitimately want to observe and react to
 *   (e.g. release a lock), not a mid-turn unwind to rethrow untouched.
 * - a `FatalError` / an awaited step rejection reaching the engine — a REAL failure a workflow's
 *   `catch` is meant to compensate for; misclassifying it as control-flow would swallow genuine
 *   errors instead of protecting them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * try {
 *   await ctx.step('chargeCard', input);
 * } catch (error) {
 *   if (isWorkflowControlFlowSignal(error)) throw error; // suspend/continue-as-new: rethrow as-is
 *   await ctx.step('refund', input); // a REAL failure — safe to run cleanup here
 *   throw error;
 * }
