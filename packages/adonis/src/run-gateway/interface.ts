 * deployment will later bind a `ProxyRunGateway` that round-trips these same verbs over the transport
 * to the control plane (Wave 2 — NOT built here). The interface is deliberately transport-agnostic —
 * every verb is `Promise`-returning (or a synchronous unsubscribe for `subscribe`) so a proxy can
 * implement it without changing a single signature.
 *
 * Verb set follows the store-less cluster design §8. Names/shapes are kept byte-compatible with
 * aviary's `RunGateway` where the same verb exists there (`topology`, `listRuns`, `cancel`,
 * `redispatchPending`, `subscribe`); the §8-only verbs (`getRun`, `getCheckpoints`, `signal`,
