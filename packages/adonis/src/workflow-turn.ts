 * The shared, PURE "run one workflow turn" body — the TypeScript twin of the Python

 * (a workflow name + input + the run's resolved `history`) it REPLAYS the registered body
 * deterministically and produces a {@link WorkflowDecision} (dispatch steps / sleep / wait-signal /
 * start-child / complete / fail / suspend). It owns NO store and does NO I/O beyond the body itself, so
 * BOTH a store-less worker (the {@link import('./worker-runtime/worker-runtime.js').WorkerRuntime}
 * consuming `workflow` jobs off `${P}-tasks-<token>`) AND the engine (via
 * {@link import('./remote-workflow-executor.js').LocalWorkflowTurnExecutor}) drive a TS workflow turn
 * through the exact same code — the same way the engine's `RemoteWorkflowExecutor` drives a Python
 * worker's turn. It is Lucid-free (imports only interface TYPES), so it rides the lean `/worker` subpath.
 *
 * The wire it emits is byte-compatible with aviary: every `ctx.*` op is keyed by a deterministic `seq`;
 * an op already resolved in `history` returns its recorded value (never re-run), and the FIRST
 * unresolved blocking op (step/sleep/waitSignal/startChild) suspends the turn, emitting its command.
 * `ctx.now()`/`ctx.sideEffect()` run inline and record their result once (a `recordStep` local step) so
 * a non-deterministic capture happens exactly once and replays the same value.
