   * `recoverStalledJobs` (the Lua/SQL that moves a claim whose `acquiredAt` is older than a cutoff back
   * from `active` to `pending`) is ONLY ever called from that same `Worker` class we bypass. So in this
   * transport nothing reclaimed a claimed job: a worker (or the engine, for result/heartbeat/control
   * jobs) that crashed between `popFrom` and `completeJob` left the job wedged in the adapter's `active`
   * set forever — there is no `waiting` state to fall back to, so the task was simply lost (observed in
   * production: jobs stuck in `…:tasks:…::active`, each stamped with a distinct dead `workerId`). This
   * sweep restores the recovery the `Worker` class would have done.
   *
   * WHY re-delivery is safe (and why default-on): durable steps are idempotent by contract, and the
   * engine ignores results for a checkpoint that already completed — so re-running a reclaimed step, or
   * re-delivering the two production shapes (result published but `completeJob` never reached; or claimed
   * and died before any result), cannot corrupt a run. The only cost is wasted work when a merely-slow
   * worker's job is re-delivered, which is why {@link DEFAULT_STALLED_THRESHOLD_MS} is deliberately
   * generous. A permanently lost job is a worse failure than a rare double-run of an idempotent step, so
   * this defaults ON; set `stalledCheckIntervalMs: 0` to opt out.
   *
   * Feature-detected: an adapter that doesn't implement `recoverStalledJobs` (not every driver does)
