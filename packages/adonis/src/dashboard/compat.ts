 *
 * - `controlPlaneDescriptor()` — the control plane's own handshake descriptor, negotiated against each
 *   worker; `undefined` when nothing has advertised yet (the handler falls back to a current-protocol CP);
 * - `fleet()` — worker descriptors grouped by routing token: the LIVE green fleet enumerated off the
 *   transport ({@link enumerateLiveFleet}, so every advertising pod shows — compatible or not, blocked or
 *   not), merged with the descriptors {@link BlockedDiagnosticsRecorder} reconstructed from past blocks;
 * - `blockedRuns()` — the runs parked `blocked` (their human reason on `run.error.message`);
 * - `diagnosticsFor(runId)` — the captured loud delta for a blocked run, when one was recorded.
 *
 * The SAME handler serves a store-less `tenant` pod: there `fleet()` is empty and `diagnosticsFor` returns
 * nothing, so the panel still lists blocked runs (reason-only) round-tripped over the wire.
