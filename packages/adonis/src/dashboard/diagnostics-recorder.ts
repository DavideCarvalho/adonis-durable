 * - `fleet()` reconstructs the live-fleet compat view — the worker descriptors last seen per routing
 *   token — so each pod can be re-negotiated against the control plane;
 * - `controlPlaneDescriptor()` is the CP side the events were negotiated against.
 *
 * Bounded by an LRU-ish cap on the per-run map (oldest evicted) so a long-lived control plane never
 * grows this without bound. Store-role only: a `tenant` pod owns no engine to subscribe to, so its
 * panel shows `blocked` runs (reason from `run.error.message`) without the enriched delta.
