 * its schedules are ignored, same as a bare `static schedule`).
 *
 * Composes: repeated `@Scheduled(...)` applications and an existing `static schedule` accumulate.
 * Decorators apply bottom-up, so each application PREPENDS — the final array reads in **source
 * order** (top decorator first, then lower ones, then the `static schedule` literal). With several
 * schedules on one class, prefer explicit `key`s over the positional `${name}:${i}` defaults: the
 * key is part of the deterministic run id, and reordering declarations would silently re-key them.
