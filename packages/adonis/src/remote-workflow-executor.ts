 * A {@link WorkflowExecutor} backed by a {@link Transport}: it advances a remote workflow by
 * dispatching a {@link WorkflowTask} over the broker and awaiting the matching {@link WorkflowDecision}
 * (correlated by `taskId`). Pass one to `engine.registerRemote(name, version, { group, executor })` so
 * a workflow authored in another SDK (e.g. the Python `durable-worker`) is driven over Redis/BullMQ.
 *
 * Recovery-safe: if the engine crashes awaiting a decision, the re-drive dispatches a fresh task with
 * the same history — the worker's replay is deterministic, so it returns the same decision; a late
 * decision for the old `taskId` simply finds no waiter and is dropped.

 * execution stays in the shared body"), so a turn body verified through the engine behaves identically
 * on a thin worker. Pass one to `engine.registerRemote(name, version, { group, executor })` to run a

 * with the engine owning durability/recovery/timers and this owning only the deterministic replay.
 *
 * Recovery-safe for the same reason {@link RemoteWorkflowExecutor} is: the engine re-drives a turn with
 * the same history, and the replay is deterministic, so it produces the same decision.
