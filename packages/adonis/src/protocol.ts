 * freshly-activated context store seeded from `snapshot` (or just `fn()` when snapshot/slot is
 * absent). Read structurally so a worker restores the originating request's userRef/tenant/traceId
 * around a step handler with zero config when context is installed — and a clean no-op (`fn()`) when
 * it is not. Wrapping (rather than the old `:set`, which only populates an already-active store) gives
 * both correct propagation AND per-task isolation on a long-lived worker: each task runs in its own
 * scope, so context never bleeds between tasks. The key is a global-registry symbol so it survives
 * duplicate copies of either package in a dependency tree.
