 * `node ace durable:retry <runId>` — re-enqueue a run for a worker to (re-)execute. Resolves the
 * engine bound by `@agora/durable`'s provider and calls its `requeue`: the run goes back to `pending`,
 * any stale lease is cleared, and a worker resumes it (replaying its checkpoints, re-attempting the
 * failed step). Run `durable:work` (or any worker) to pick it up.
